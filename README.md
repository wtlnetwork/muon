## LAN Games:
__If you don't have many LAN PvP and/or Co-Op enabled games in you libaray, have a browse here for suggestions!__

**Caution**: As of the release (02/27/2025), a total of 5 games were tested using Muon 0.1.0, and some games may not work as intended.
Games with legacy browser searches will work, but some games that use an alternative method of scanning for host servers may not function properly.
We are working on ensuring that the plugin works with every possible LAN game.

Testing waiting room:
* Rainbow Six Vegas 2
* Splinter Cell Chaos Theory

Tested Games: 
* [Quake III Arena](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/Quake_III_Arena/)
* [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/)
* [Counter-Strike: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/)

Untested Selection:
* [Steam Store of LAN Games](https://store.steampowered.com/category/multiplayer_lan/)
* [4 Player+ Curator Page](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11707935-More-Than-4-Local-Multiplayer/?appid=1739300)

## Planned Updates:

* UI Improvements
* Steam Deck OLED Support
* Advanced Settings Tab for Host
* ???

## Precaution:
__We do not recommend the following actions, and we will not take any responsibility if you choose to proceed with the following:__

* Using more than two Steam Decks for Ad-Hoc connections (for untested reasons, likely to change based on research and feedback)
* Using Muon during flights or air travel
* Sharing your passphrase with strangers
* Using Muon on hardware-demanding games (as this could cause overloading for the host Steam Deck)
